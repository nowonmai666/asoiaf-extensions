ASOIAF extensions
=================

CSS fixes for /r/asoiaf by /u/nowonmai666

ASOIAF Despoiler
----------------

This is the extension I actually use.

The original version merely modified spoiler-tagged content so that it was visible without hovering (but still marked as a spoiler to prevent gaffes).

It was modified to rectify some of the poor decisions in the 3.0 stylesheet that appeared in August 2013.

###Features and Comments

* I don't know how to restore the scrollbars to their default state; I'm pretty sure it can't be done with pure CSS and would need Javascript. Maybe later.
* Top bar is no longer hidden.
* Links next to comment count are no longer hidden.
* Clean white background.
* Boxes around links removed.
* Space between lins increased.
* Flairs and labels made less aggressive.
* Big ugly picture removed from sidebar.
* Mishmash of fonts replaced with a single stack of (in my opinion) decent fonts. Most people will end up with Verdana.
* Various tweaks to make the stylesheet less disastrous in combination with Reddit Enhancement Suite.

###Installation

Safari extension: download it and double click it.

Chrome extension: download it and unzip. Open the Extensions pane from the Tools menu, and drag the extension onto that.

Firefox and Internet Explorer: you're on your own for now, but if you know what to do with the css file, there it is: `asoiaf.css`.

ASOIAF shields
-------------

For people who want to switch off all subreddit styles in Reddit preferences, but still see the fancy shields.

I don't use this; let me know if it breaks.

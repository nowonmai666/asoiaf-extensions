ASOIAF Despoiler
----------------

This extension unhides spoiler text so you don't have to mouse over it. The text remains tagged and highlighted to help readers keep appropriate spoiler discipline in mind when replying.

ASOIAF Stylefix
---------------

Adjusts the subreddit's custom CSS to be more to my liking.

Partial feature list:

* Ensmallens the header.
* Makes fewer UI elements overlap with each other.
* Tidies up the sidebar.
* Improves font consistency.
* Makes assorted small, hidden or low-contrast text more visible.
* Makes comment threads easier on the eye with subtler styles for nested comments.

For people who want to switch off all subreddit styles in Reddit preferences, but still see the fancy shields.
